The *Kiwi* module combines geneset analyses with biological networks to visualize 
the interactions between genesets that are significant in a given biological system. 
*Kiwi* can be found at the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/KiwiDist>`_ and
it can be accessed as an online tool in the `BioMet Toolbox  <http://biomet-toolbox.org/>`_.
